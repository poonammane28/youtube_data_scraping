1. ""Chain Reactions"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends learn numbers, shapes and colors while using educational chain reactions. Suddenly, Alex the Helicopter flies in and tells them that Bubble the Robot is stuck in a basketball hoop and needs help. The clever toys then decide to build a giant chain reaction set using toy cars, buses, 3d shapes, boats, dominoes, marbles, and even a toy train. With your help, Bubble the Robot is in good hands! 

2. ""Toby the Garbage Truck"" - It's a beautiful day in the park for a toy car race! Joe the Monster Truck and Blazin' Bill the Monster Truck teach race cars how to race. Max the Glow Train and his friends arrive to watch the show too. One of Max's new friends is Toby the Garbage Truck. 
  While the toys watch the car race, Toby the Garbage Truck is too busy finding trash in the park here and there. 
   After the race, the toys clean after themselves and start heading home. Toby the Garbage Truck discovers a dirty pond full of trash. The toys have to act fast to help clean the pond and recycle all the trash! Let's keep this planet clean! 

3. ""Read with us"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends receive an unusual device called a Word Machine. After they read a word the machine makes a toy. Something happens and the machine goes out of control!

Using their imagination, the toys see a real size train, they go underwater, fly in the clouds, skate on ice, pretend the floor is lava, they go to the moon, ride a roller coaster, and see a real pirate ship with treasure! They also meet a new friend named Cube the Robot!

5. ""Chain Reactions | Physics"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends arrive at the Robo-J5‚Äôs physics lab. This lab uses chain reactions to study gravity, magnetism, lights, heat and energy, buoyancy, friction and simple machines.

6. ""Animal Rescue"" - Max the Glow Train and his friends do their best to free a turtle from plastic that's wrapped around its shell. Unfortunately they cannot. 
  Next, Cube the Robot gets a message from Robo-J5 saying that she can help the turtle. All they have to do is take the mine train to get to her.  While on their way to see Robo-J5, the toys do more good deeds by helping other animals!  
   One of Max‚Äôs friends is a small curious robot named Clam.  While Robo-J5 explains about physics, curious Clam activates a chain reaction machine. The toys use physics to help Clam!

7. ""Learn Letters"" - Join this amazing adventure with Max the Glow Train, letters and toys.  
 Max is a fun loving toy train who teaches children the English alphabet. On his way to the zoo Max meets the letters and takes them with him.

Firstly, submarines would lose one of their biggest advantages, anybody will be able to spot them.
Secondly, predators will probably increase in number, it will be difficult for fishes to hide, there will be complete chaos everywhere.
Thirdly, temperature of oceans will rise as transparent oceans mean more sunlight, this might be good news for plants which perform photosynthesis but very bad news for much of marine life which will not be able to adjust to this increase in temperature.
Fourthly, it might prove to be a double-edged sword, while hidden treasures might reveal themselves but at the same time tons and tons of human generated waste hidden inside oceans will suddenly become visible.
Lastly, marine life which has evolved in darkness might find it difficult to adopt.",It's AumSum Time,"aum, aumsum, aum sum, it's aumsum time, smart learning for all, education, science, Secondary School (School Category), animation, school, learn, learning, kid, kids, children, What if Oceans were Transparent, what if, what, if, oceans",27,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge,2020-03-07T10:30:01Z,PT6M16S,18800638,0,True,,

The toy used in this video has small parts and is not for children under 3 years old.  

This educational video for toddlers includes speech practice, learning colors, phonics, pretend play skills, simple songs, animals, first words, first sentences, letters and sign language! We will also learn colors with giant crayon surprises! We will open each color giant crayon and find fun giant crayon surprises that inspire us to sing simple songs that help with speech and language development, gestures, imitation and are so much fun! We‚Äôll learn each color of the rainbow with these fun, engaging surprises! Our songs for toddlers will also encourage kids to get up and move and exercise! 

Something unique about our learning videos is a teacher, Ms Rachel, is on screen modeling language, gestures, pretend play and being incredibly interactive with viewers. We also show her mouth close up so children can focus on how sounds and words are formed. This may help children with speech development. 

If you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. For some of our videos, I worked with the brilliant speech language pathologists (speech therapists) at Chatterbox NYC. You can find them at www.chatterboxnyc.com I am not a speech therapist myself. I am a music teacher with a masters in music education. 

We have many more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos. We are incredibly passionate about early childhood education! If you are looking for the best learning videos, you will see how much time, care and research we put into each toddler video we create. Rachel uses single words, simple sentences and speaks slowly so children can really hear the language. This video also includes a section of very slow speech practice which may be helpful for children with speech delays and apraxia.  We aim for our videos to be incredibly interactive and engaging, not passive watching because research shows that this is most beneficial. 

We use simple songs, fun sounds, music, basic sign language, and first words to build vocabulary. I show gestures and signs because are they are incredibly important building blocks for language development. 

We have many different kids of videos for babies and toddlers on our channel.  We have full baby music classes and full toddler music classes. We have many videos with fun baby songs and toddler songs, and we also have videos that aim to help with speech development and first words. We also have preschool videos for preschoolers. These are great videos for teaching toddlers preschool readiness skills! They are full of preschool lessons that are great for 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds, 4 year olds and even 5 year olds or older! We also have preschool music classes. 

Rachel teaches preschool music to young kids, toddlers, and babies and has a masters degree in music education from NYU. She has also been a toddler teacher at a school for children with special needs including autism, apraxia, speech delays, developmental delays, down syndrome and cerebral palsy. 

Many people are involved in designing our videos. On our team we have: speech-language pathologists, a reading specialist, a Broadway musician, an early childhood curriculum specialist, a child and family therapist, and award-winning songwriters! 

This video is edited by Aron Accurso of Songs for Littles and Simone Kiseiel, the founder of Magic Dog Productions. 

These are some of the best educational videos for kids you will find. Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech for babies, toddlers, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and older! 

We put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words.

At BabyBus, our goal is to make learning a fun and imaginative experience for kids aged 2 - 6 by creating classic nursery rhymes, kid songs, and stories with 2D & 3D animations. 

In the BabyBus world, KiKi, Miumiu, and their friends inspire kids to experience true friendship, care, creativity, and imagination in a fun and smart way. Through our songs and animations, kids around the world can learn about colors, letters, life skills, good habits, safety tips, and more in a fun and educational way.

In the eyes of Kiki and Miumiu, all things are alive: you can talk to animals, you can make friends with vehicles... All the activities can be enjoyed, you can experience different occupations, you can go everywhere... All the unknowns are interesting: what will be in space? Are there aliens on earth?... Join Kiki and Miumiu for the exploration of this world together!

Mastering English pronunciation can be a challenge, but in this video, we help you improve your English accent in just 10 minutes. Whether you're learning English as a second language or want to refine your spoken English skills, this video is packed with practical tips to enhance your pronunciation and clarity. Focusing on key aspects of standard English pronunciation, we'll guide you through the most common challenges learners face and show you how to overcome them.

One of the major hurdles in English pronunciation is mastering the ""TH"" sound, which is unique and tricky for many speakers. We'll break it down for you, showing how to position your tongue and practice this sound effectively. You'll also learn how to distinguish between voiced and voiceless ""TH"" sounds to sound more natural and fluent.

Another focus of this lesson is the difference between long ""ee"" and short ""i"" sounds. Mispronouncing these can lead to confusion in communication, so we'll help you hear the difference and practice them correctly. With clear examples and easy-to-follow exercises, you'll build confidence in pronouncing words like ""sheep"" versus ""ship"" and ""feet"" versus ""fit."" By the end of this video, you'll feel more comfortable and accurate in your vowel pronunciation.

This video also covers other essential tips to improve your English pronunciation overall. We dive into the rhythm, stress, and intonation of spoken English to help you sound more natural and confident. You'll learn to identify which syllables to stress and how to match the natural flow of English speech patterns. If you've ever struggled with blending sounds or making your speech sound connected and smooth, we have actionable advice to help you achieve that.

Improving your English pronunciation doesn't just make you sound better‚Äîit boosts your overall communication skills and makes you feel more understood and confident in any situation. Whether you're preparing for a job interview, studying for exams, or simply wanting to improve your English accent, this 10-minute lesson is your fast-track to better pronunciation.

By focusing on these proven techniques, you can eliminate common mistakes and take your English speaking skills to the next level. Watch the full video, practice along, and notice the difference in your clarity and fluency.

Talk to your pediatrician and also call early intervention! The sooner you get help, the better. Definitely try to get speech therapy for your child. 

We hope our videos are also helpful for your little one! Ms Rachel's son had a speech delay, and she became very passionate about trying to help toddlers with their language development. 

Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech for babies, toddlers, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and older! We show a mouth close-up, which may be helpful to children with speech delays and apraxia. This video focuses on over 25 first words! Ms Rachel is a master at encouraging speech 

In this toddler learning video we show many common first words and functional words that can help toddlers communicate what they need and want. 

Words focused on include: Mama, Dada, Hi, Me, More, Go, Help, Eat, Open, I, Want, No, Ya, Mama, Dada, Ball, On, One, Two, Three, Done, Banana, Teddy Bear, Baby, Bubble, Down, Tummy, Peek-A-Boo, Bye. 

As well as speech practice sessions, we introduce simple songs that help children with gestures and language. Gestures and imitation are important skills for toddlers! We also demonstrate another important skill for toddlers, pretend and imaginative play. Our videos have also been helpful for children with autism. 

If you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. 

Rachel is not a speech therapist, but on several videos she has worked with speech therapists to share helpful techniques for speech practice.

Rachel has worked with children with special needs including autism, down syndrome, speech delays, apraxia, cerebral palsy and global developmental delays. She believes all children are smart, important, gifted, valuable and our teachers. 

We put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words.

Hello Friends and welcome to a new happy learning video. Today we are going to talk about some animals that existed 65 million years ago. I am sure you have heard about the dinosaurs, and I am certain you have seen many films and cartoons featuring dinosaurs. But...not everything that is told in these films is correct. So, if you don‚Äôt mind, let‚Äôs find out what they really were like and how they lived.
The first thing we need to understand is that people and dinosaurs never lived together.
The dinosaurs lived before human beings existed and they roamed the Earth for approximately 135 million years. That‚Äôs a really long time! They were the dominating vertebrates. Nowadays more than 500 different species have been identified thanks to bones and fossils found.
All dinosaurs were oviparous, meaning they reproduced by laying eggs but there were huge differences between them; some were very small while others were absolutely enormous...
So as to learn about them better, we have divided them into two major groups:
The Ornithischia and the Saurischia. What complicated names they have!
The Ornithischia or ‚Äúbird-hipped‚Äù dinosaurs were herbivore, which means they only ate plants. The most well-known was the Triceratops. They were impressive, huh?
The Saurischia or ‚Äúlizard hipped‚Äù dinosaurs are the ancestors of the crocodiles and lizards. Among this species there were carnivores and herbivores and within them the two most famous dinosaurs, the

 diplodocus and the tyrannosaurus.
The diplodocus was the largest dinosaur. In 1907 an entire skeleton was found measuring 27 meters, although remains of these specimens have been found exceeding 50 meters. In these images you can observe just how enormous they were...
The Tyrannosaurus was and still is the most fearsome predator which has ever existed on our Planet. It was more than 4 metres high and could be up to 12 meters in length. In its mouth it had 60 razor sharp pointed teeth, and it could run...65 kms per hour!!! The truth is I would be absolutely petrified if I were to come across such an animal...
But wait a minute, how is it possible that such large and powerful animals completely disappeared off the face of the Earth?
Currently, the investigators are focusing on two big theories: the first is based on the impact of an asteroid or comet from outer space. The other theory maintains that the cause of the dinosaurs‚Äô disappearance was due to a period of enormous volcanic activity. We actually still don‚Äôt truly know the reason. But what we do know with absolute certainty is that, right now, at this very moment there are still many animals in great danger of becoming extinct, and could even disappear. All of us can help them survive. How? By respecting nature, recycling, contaminating the least bit possible, buying only what we really need...If we make these efforts we will be able to live in a much healthier planet and we will at the same time be ensuring that no animal, not a single one, will ever be in danger of extinction again. Let‚Äôs hope with everybody‚Äôs help, we can make it happen.

‚ù§ Sheriff Labrador's Safety Talk ‚ù§
Kids, magnets have a magical force, so they can attract things made of iron.
Toys made of magnets are a lot of fun, but we must also be careful.
Keep magnets away from TVs, computers, and phones because magnets can damage them.
Also, never put magnets in your mouth so that you won't accidentally swallow them, and don't put them in your ears or nose, as they could seriously hurt you.

Welcome to Sheriff Labrador‚Äôs world! Sheriff Labrador and his assistant, Officer Doberman, aim at protecting the safety of the residents of the Forest Town. They always try their best to solve problems whenever they arise, and bring cunning criminals to justice!

Sheriff Labrador is smart, witty, and knowledgeable, and there's no case that he can't solve!
Officer Doberman is brave and agile, and good at Kung Fu. No criminals can escape from him!

Our goal is to provide children aged 3-6 with knowledge of safety, common sense and science literacy. We hope that this will help them understand their surroundings, improve their safety awareness, and grow up healthily.

The Sheriff Labrador series helps children to:
‚òÖ Think Independently
‚òÖ Exercise Logical Thinking
‚òÖ Develop Teamwork
‚òÖ Explore the World

The Human Heart

Hello Friends, welcome to a new Happy Learning Video. Today, we‚Äôre going to get to know the engine in our body, today we‚Äôre going to get to know the human heart. 

The heart is the most special muscle which we have. It‚Äôs situated a little to the left from the center of our chest, between our lungs and is in an oblique position, positioned diagonally. 

We say that it‚Äôs very special because it sends blood all over our body. Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients we need to live to all of our cells.

Our heart is a type of pump, like the ones we use to inflate the wheels on our bikes, the only thing is, that instead of pumping air, it pumps blood. 

The heart is divided into two parts. The right part and the left part, separated by a cellular wall, so they are not connected internally. 

Each one of these parts has two chambers or cavities. The upper cavities are called right and left atrium. And the lower cavities are called right and left ventricle. The heart also has four kind of doors which are called valves. These valves open to let blood in and then they close so this blood can‚Äôt go back. 

Now we‚Äôve got to know the most important parts of the heart. But‚Ä¶ Do you know how it works? 

It all commences, in the right atrium, where the deoxygenated blood, meaning it has very little oxygen and nutrients, it enters the heart, then it goes past the first valve up to the right ventricle. Once it is here, the heart sends the blood directly to the lungs. And it‚Äôs in this moment, where the blood is oxygenated and is filled with oxygen and nutrients. When it is already oxygenated, it goes back to the heart reaching the left atrium, from where it will pass through the third valve until the last cavity, the left ventricle. Finally, the heart sends this now oxygenated blood through the fourth and last valve towards the rest of the body‚Ä¶ and it starts again!!! 
To understand how our heart beats, we only need to imagine that our hand is a heart and that when it opens up it fills up with blood, and when it‚Äôs closed it pumps that blood outwards.

When blood exits our heart, it flows through our whole body through blood vessels and there are three types: arteries, veins and capillary vessels. 
Arteries deliver oxygen and nutrient rich blood to all organs in our body, veins take that blood, low in oxygen, back to the heart and the capillary vessels, which are very small, connect arteries with veins and cells. 

Fun Fact! Do you know approximately how much a human heart weighs? Well it‚Äôs 450 grams, almost half a kilo. 

The truth is that the heart is the engine in our circulatory system and is an incredibly strong muscle, it‚Äôs able to beat more than 100 thousand times a day. So cool!!!

We can‚Äôt say goodbye without giving you a tip! WE need to take care of our hear and that‚Äôs why we need to do physical exercise, we need to eat healthy foods, and please, never ever smoke, it‚Äôs the worst thing you can do to hurt your heart.

Mastering English pronunciation can be a challenge, but in this video, we help you improve your English accent in just 10 minutes. Whether you're learning English as a second language or want to refine your spoken English skills, this video is packed with practical tips to enhance your pronunciation and clarity. Focusing on key aspects of standard English pronunciation, we'll guide you through the most common challenges learners face and show you how to overcome them.

One of the major hurdles in English pronunciation is mastering the ""TH"" sound, which is unique and tricky for many speakers. We'll break it down for you, showing how to position your tongue and practice this sound effectively. You'll also learn how to distinguish between voiced and voiceless ""TH"" sounds to sound more natural and fluent.

Another focus of this lesson is the difference between long ""ee"" and short ""i"" sounds. Mispronouncing these can lead to confusion in communication, so we'll help you hear the difference and practice them correctly. With clear examples and easy-to-follow exercises, you'll build confidence in pronouncing words like ""sheep"" versus ""ship"" and ""feet"" versus ""fit."" By the end of this video, you'll feel more comfortable and accurate in your vowel pronunciation.

This video also covers other essential tips to improve your English pronunciation overall. We dive into the rhythm, stress, and intonation of spoken English to help you sound more natural and confident. You'll learn to identify which syllables to stress and how to match the natural flow of English speech patterns. If you've ever struggled with blending sounds or making your speech sound connected and smooth, we have actionable advice to help you achieve that.

Improving your English pronunciation doesn't just make you sound better‚Äîit boosts your overall communication skills and makes you feel more understood and confident in any situation. Whether you're preparing for a job interview, studying for exams, or simply wanting to improve your English accent, this 10-minute lesson is your fast-track to better pronunciation.

By focusing on these proven techniques, you can eliminate common mistakes and take your English speaking skills to the next level. Watch the full video, practice along, and notice the difference in your clarity and fluency.

Dad! 
Why is it called History?
And not ‚Äúher story‚Äù!
Are women and girls not talked about in History?

That‚Äôs not true, Chiku!
Let me tell you how History got its name!
The English language we speak in is based on a language called Latin. 
And Latin is based on the Greek language.
And in ancient Greece the people who kept asking questions were called historia!

Do you mean questions like ‚Äúwhy and when did something happen and‚Ä¶‚Äù?

So the ‚Äúhistoria‚Äù were people like ChaCha!

Right!
The historia asked questions.
Only because they were smart.
You see, when we ask questions, we learn a lot more!

Ahh!

And so ‚Äúhistoria‚Äù became History and‚Ä¶.

ChaCha will never stop asking questions!

He‚Äôs our very own historia!

Let‚Äôs play a game!
Today is the present!
The week that just went by is the past!
Tell me all the things that made you happy, sad, or angry from the past!
And did you learn anything from them?

I was happy when I planted a tree!
Because I know it will give me fruit some day!

I was sad when my puppy ran away because I forgot to shut the gate!

I lost a race because I looked away!

And I grew angry for letting Cussly watch over a cake I baked.

So you see, the learning of the past helps us understand what
we did right or where we went wrong!
And it helps us live better and have a better future!

We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.

The Human Heart

Hello Friends, welcome to a new Happy Learning Video. Today, we‚Äôre going to get to know the engine in our body, today we‚Äôre going to get to know the human heart. 

The heart is the most special muscle which we have. It‚Äôs situated a little to the left from the center of our chest, between our lungs and is in an oblique position, positioned diagonally. 

We say that it‚Äôs very special because it sends blood all over our body. Blood delivers oxygen and nutrients we need to live to all of our cells.

Our heart is a type of pump, like the ones we use to inflate the wheels on our bikes, the only thing is, that instead of pumping air, it pumps blood. 

The heart is divided into two parts. The right part and the left part, separated by a cellular wall, so they are not connected internally. 

Each one of these parts has two chambers or cavities. The upper cavities are called right and left atrium. And the lower cavities are called right and left ventricle. The heart also has four kind of doors which are called valves. These valves open to let blood in and then they close so this blood can‚Äôt go back. 

Now we‚Äôve got to know the most important parts of the heart. But‚Ä¶ Do you know how it works? 

It all commences, in the right atrium, where the deoxygenated blood, meaning it has very little oxygen and nutrients, it enters the heart, then it goes past the first valve up to the right ventricle. Once it is here, the heart sends the blood directly to the lungs. And it‚Äôs in this moment, where the blood is oxygenated and is filled with oxygen and nutrients. When it is already oxygenated, it goes back to the heart reaching the left atrium, from where it will pass through the third valve until the last cavity, the left ventricle. Finally, the heart sends this now oxygenated blood through the fourth and last valve towards the rest of the body‚Ä¶ and it starts again!!! 
To understand how our heart beats, we only need to imagine that our hand is a heart and that when it opens up it fills up with blood, and when it‚Äôs closed it pumps that blood outwards.

When blood exits our heart, it flows through our whole body through blood vessels and there are three types: arteries, veins and capillary vessels. 
Arteries deliver oxygen and nutrient rich blood to all organs in our body, veins take that blood, low in oxygen, back to the heart and the capillary vessels, which are very small, connect arteries with veins and cells. 

Fun Fact! Do you know approximately how much a human heart weighs? Well it‚Äôs 450 grams, almost half a kilo. 

The truth is that the heart is the engine in our circulatory system and is an incredibly strong muscle, it‚Äôs able to beat more than 100 thousand times a day. So cool!!!

We can‚Äôt say goodbye without giving you a tip! WE need to take care of our hear and that‚Äôs why we need to do physical exercise, we need to eat healthy foods, and please, never ever smoke, it‚Äôs the worst thing you can do to hurt your heart.

This Timelume‚Ñ¢ series was produced by ChuChu TV Studios LLP.

Let‚Äôs play a game!
Today is the present!
The week that just went by is the past!
Tell me all the things that made you happy, sad, or angry from the past!
And did you learn anything from them?

I was happy when I planted a tree!
Because I know it will give me fruit some day!

I was sad when my puppy ran away because I forgot to shut the gate!

I lost a race because I looked away!

And I grew angry for letting Cussly watch over a cake I baked.

So you see, the learning of the past helps us understand what
we did right or where we went wrong!
And it helps us live better and have a better future!

Dad! 
Look! 
We have a new subject in school! 
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHis‚Ä¶story!‚Äù 

Your subject is called ‚ÄúHistory‚Äù and not ‚ÄúHis story‚Äù.

So what is History about?

It‚Äô about things, events and the people from long ago.
People like Cleopatra!
Abraham Lincoln!
Mahatma Gandhi!
Florence Nightingale!
And Shakespeare!
For example, these brothers and how they invented the airplane long ago.

I get it!
History is all about things, events and people from the past.

So yesterday was today‚Äôs history!
And what‚Äôs happening today will be history tomorrow!

I dressed up like a brave knight last week! 
That‚Äôs part of my history!
(terrified)
Eeooow!

And today you‚Äôre scared of a rubber spidey!
Tomorrow, that will be a part of your history too!

We all loved it, but it seems that the message is still not implemented. Because even today in 2022, the pressure on students to pursue stereotypical degrees like engineering, doctor, etc. is real. A kid has to convince his parents to allow him to do something like becoming a YouTuber, Graphic Designer, Video Editor, etc. But why the situation is like this? Why do we have such strong stereotypes? Watch this video by Dhruv Rathee as he explains the root cause of this unfortunate problem that continues to exist in our society for decades - the education system.
